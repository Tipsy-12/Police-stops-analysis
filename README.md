Project Report: Analysis of Rhode Island Traffic Stop Data

Executive Summary:
This project involved a comprehensive analysis of traffic stop data from Rhode Island, covering all stops from 2013 onwards. Using advanced data science techniques, we explored patterns in police interactions, demographic factors, and potential biases in traffic stops. Our analysis provides valuable insights for policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and researchers studying public safety and civil rights.

Key Technologies and Techniques:

1. Data Processing and Analysis:
   - Python
   - Pandas for data manipulation
   - NumPy for numerical computations

2. Data Visualization:
   - Matplotlib
   - Seaborn for statistical data visualization

3. Statistical Analysis:
   - Descriptive statistics
   - Correlation analysis
   - Time series analysis

4. Machine Learning:
   - Feature engineering
   - Categorical data encoding

Key Findings and Insights:

1. Demographic Analysis:
   - Explored driver demographics including age, gender, and race
   - Identified potential disparities in stop rates among different groups

2. Violation Patterns:
   - Analyzed most common traffic violations
   - Investigated the relationship between violation type and driver characteristics

3. Search Conduct Analysis:
   - Examined factors influencing police searches during stops
   - Assessed potential biases in search rates across demographic groups

4. Temporal Trends:
   - Analyzed traffic stop patterns by time of day, day of week, and month
   - Identified peak hours and seasonal trends in traffic stops

5. Geographical Insights:
   - Mapped stop locations to identify hotspots and regional variations

6. Duration Analysis:
   - Investigated factors influencing the length of traffic stops
   - Correlated stop duration with violation type and driver characteristics

Advanced Techniques Employed:

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
   - Handled missing values and outliers
   - Standardized date and time formats

2. Feature Engineering:
   - Created derived features such as age groups and time of day categories
   - Encoded categorical variables for analysis

3. Time Series Decomposition:
   - Analyzed trends, seasonality, and cyclical patterns in stop data
